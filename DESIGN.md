# Design

The frontend will feature a gallery akin to Steam Cards.

Layout: Scrollable Grid or Horizontal Slider Rows

When clicking on Standalones it opens the local video player of the device.
When clicking on Compounds it opens a overview of the Children to select from (Showing the user-defined Series thumbnail and Episode number) Compounds can have compounds themselves (Think a TV series with multiple Seasons). If that's the case, clicking on a Compound opens a View showing the Seasons in a grid or row. Clicking on a Season opens the Season Overview


So we have following Views:

- Media View (General View showing all available Media (Series, Movies etc.))
- Series View (Showing all Seasons)
- Season View (Showing all Episodes)
